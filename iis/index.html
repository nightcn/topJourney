    <h1>Interneting Is Easy!</h1>
    <p>First, we need to learn some basic HTML.</p>

    <h2>Headings</h2>
    <p>Headings define the outline of your site. There are six levels of headings.</p>

    <!-- LISTS -->
    <h2>Lists</h2>
    <p>This is how you make an unordered list:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Add a "ul" element (it stands for unordered list)</li>
        <li>Add each item in its own "li" element</li>
        <li>They don't need to be in any particular order</li>
    </ul>
